Mastering Leap Motion Unity Project
==================================
This repository contains the complete project that is used within chapters five, six and seven of the upcoming book "Mastering Leap Motion".

How do I use it?
=
To make use of the project, simply pull it down to your local machine and open it within Unity!

Everything is pre-configured to "just work", with the exception of Leap.dll, LeapCSharp.dll and LeapCSharp.NET3.5.dll. These can not be redistributed via third parties; you can find these files within the Leap Motion SDK at https://developer.leapmotion.com/.  Once downloaded, place Leap.dll and LeapCSharp.dll in the root directory of the project, and place LeapCSharp.NET3.5.dll in the Assets folder of the project.

Other questions?
